### Creating a virtual environment
Python “Virtual Environments” allow Python packages to be installed in an isolated location for a particular application, rather than being installed globally.

```bash
# creating a virtual environment

$python3 -m venv envname

# activating it

$source envname/bin/activate
```

### Installing the library

```bash
$pip3 install algovis
```
